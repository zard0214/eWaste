# Project - eWaste Recycling (B2C)

The project aims to offer a hub where devices can be identified according to age and demand with an option for owners to pay for data retrieval.  Where devices might be resold, e.g. newish smart phones, etc., then the hub should identify third parties where the owner might sell their device, with a referrer fee paid by the third party for successful reselling.  The seller would still be offered an option of having data retrieved and their device wiped (with the fee).

The Hub will be a web application with web server/database with desktop view.
